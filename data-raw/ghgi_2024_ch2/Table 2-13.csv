a Consists of emissions from jet fuel consumed by domestic operations of commercial aircraft (no bunkers).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Consists of emissions from jet fuel and aviation gasoline consumption by general aviation and military aircraft.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Fluctuations in emission estimates are associated with fluctuations in reported fuel consumption and may reflect issues with data sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Other emissions from electric power are a result of waste incineration (as the majority of MSW is combusted in “trash-to-steam” electric power plants), electrical equipment, and a portion of other process uses of carbonates (from pollution control equipment installed in electric power plants).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e CO2 estimates reflect natural gas used to power pipelines, but not electricity. While the operation of pipelines produces CH4 and N2O, these emissions are not directly attributed to pipelines in the Inventory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f Emissions from International Bunker Fuels include emissions from both civilian and military activities; these emissions are not included in the transportation totals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g Ethanol and biodiesel CO2 estimates are presented for informational purposes only. See Section 3.11 and the estimates in LULUCF (see Chapter 6), in line with IPCC methodological guidance and reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC, for more information on ethanol and biodiesel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notes: Passenger cars and light-duty trucks include vehicles typically used for personal travel and less than 8,500 lbs; medium- and heavy-duty trucks include vehicles larger than 8,500 lbs. HFC emissions primarily reflect HFC-134a. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
